## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/arya2004/algorithms).
2. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy of the repository in your account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms.git
cd DAA-algorithms
```

### 3. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Changes
- Navigate to the relevant topic folder (e.g., `DivideAndConquer/`, `DynamicProgramming/`) and add or modify code.
- Follow consistent coding styles:
  - Proper indentation
  - Meaningful variable names
  - Add comments explaining complex parts of the code

### 5. Test Your Code
- Ensure your code runs without errors.
- Test with multiple inputs to validate correctness and robustness.

### 6. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add code for [specific algorithm or feature]"
```

### 7. Push to Your Fork
Push your branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request
1. Go to the original repository.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab and select **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes.
4. Submit the pull request.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your code is relevant to the syllabus and fits within the existing structure.
- Clearly explain your code with inline comments and, if needed, in a separate `README.md` within the folder.
- Write clean, efficient, and modular code.
- Use consistent naming conventions for files and variables.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; stick to the standard libraries whenever possible.

## Areas for Contribution

### Code Contributions
- Add missing algorithms or techniques from the syllabus.
- Optimize existing code for better time or space complexity.
- Provide alternate solutions for existing problems using different paradigms.

### Documentation
- Improve documentation in `README.md` or add explanations for new code.
- Fix typos or clarify ambiguous instructions.

### Testing
- Report bugs or incorrect outputs.
- Add test cases for existing algorithms to handle edge cases.
