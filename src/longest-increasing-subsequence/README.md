# Longest Increasing Subsequence

This directory contains implementations of the longest increasing subsequence algorithm in various programming languages.

The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.

The implementations in this directory are:
- C++: `longest-increasing-subsequence.cpp`
- Python: `longest-increasing-subsequence.py`
