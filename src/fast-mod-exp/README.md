# Fast Modulo Exponentiation

This directory contains implementations of the fast modulo exponentiation algorithm in various programming languages.

This algorithm is used to compute `(a^b) mod m` efficiently.

The implementations in this directory are:
- C: `c/fast-modulo-exponentiation.c`
- C++: `fast-modulo-exponentiation.cpp`
- Python: `fast-modulo-exponentiation.py`
