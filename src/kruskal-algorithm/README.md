# Kruskal's Algorithm

This directory contains an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm in C++.

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph that form a tree that includes every vertex and has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph.

The implementation in this directory is:
- C++: `kruskals-algorithm.cpp`
