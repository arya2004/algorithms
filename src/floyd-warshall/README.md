# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

This directory contains an implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm in C++.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).

The implementation in this directory is:
- C++: `floyd-warshall-algorithm.cpp`
