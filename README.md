# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab

This repository contains lab codes for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course, providing practical implementations of key algorithmic concepts and design strategies. The codes are organized by topics as per the course syllabus.

---

## Code Structure

The `src` directory contains the following folders, each representing a specific topic:

1. [01_dearrangements](src/01_dearrangements/): Implementation of dearrangement algorithms.
2. [01_random_permutation](src/01_random_permutation/): Random permutation generation.
3. [02_quick_merge_sort](src/02_quick_merge_sort/): Quick sort and k-way merge sort implementations.
4. [03_Josephers](src/03_Josephers/): Josephus problem solutions.
5. [04_searching](src/04_searching/): Searching algorithms.
6. [05_Fast_Modulo_Exponent](src/05_Fast_Modulo_Exponent/): Fast modular exponentiation.
7. [06_longest_increasing_subsequence](src/06_longest_increasing_subsequence/): Longest increasing subsequence algorithms.
8. [07_kadance](src/07_kadance/): Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray sum.
9. [08_huffman](src/08_huffman/): Huffman coding implementation.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the desired folder inside the `src` directory.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, to compile `main.cpp` in the `01_dearrangements` folder, run:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ```
3. Execute the compiled file. For example:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed and properly configured in your system's PATH.
